/* 20161005:
   About 20160927 Tino Dornbusch posted PDF of SphereOptics calibration certificate, which reads
   "Sample: Zenith Polymer Diffuse Reflectance Standard - 99%R
   Report-No: 16042606
   PO-NO.: 600982
   Customer: LemnaTec GmbH
   The 8 degree/hemispherical spectral reflectance was measured for the sample listed above. The calibration was performed with a standard from SphereOptics GmbH, part number SG3051, traceable to the PTB (Physikalisch Technische Bundesanstalt), calibration certificate: PTB 44052/15. The reflectance was determined by using a Perkin-Elmer Lambda 950 UV-VIS-NIR spectrometer (serial number 950L1211082) equipped with a 150 mm PTFE sphere (certified by PTB Braunschweig, Germany)."

   A few days later, maybe 20161001, David LeBauer (or TinoDornbusch) posted a reflectance file here: https://github.com/terraref/reference-data/blob/master/Zenith%20LiteT%20Diffuse%20Reflectance%20Target%20-%2095%25R.csv
   Presumably these reflectances are for the SphereOptics part in the certification.
   The file header reads "Factory calibration of Zenith Lite Diffuse Reflectance Target - 95%R.csv;Reflectivity: 95% (UV-VIS-NIR);DETECTOR-PC\admin;10.04.2014 15:35:46;Lambda 950;950L1211082;1.61.00 Lambda 900".
   Data are 2201 absolute calibrated reflectances at 1 nm resolution from 250--2450 nm.

/* exposure_reference is exposure measured when pointing at spectralon reference target
   Camera exposed to natural light reflecting from reference target for standard exposure time accumulates exposure_reference counts in each channel
   Expected to be large fraction (assumed here to be fake_factory_calibrate_reflectance) of exposure_theoretical_maximum for white reflector
   However, grey reference reflector might be more optimal than white
   Plants have maximum reflectance of ~0.4 so calibrating at white not as accurate as calibrating near 0.4
   We hope Lemnatec tunes exposure time to achieve the greatest dynamic range, and thus precision, under a wide range of circumstances
   One tuning consideration is that maximum exposure for white reflector at noon is close to but does not exceed exposure_theoretical_maximum
   Other tuning considerations are possible... */
